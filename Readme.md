Docker image could not be created. Could not solved maven dependency problem.
Even though it works in STS, Maven has failed in command line jar creation stage.
It is plug-in related for my guess but Couldn't solved the problem.

Unit tests only for database related operations. Couldn't write for Rest Methods.
Try with MockupMVC but couldn't have to finish that part.
